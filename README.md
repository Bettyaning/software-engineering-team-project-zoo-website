this a brief overview:
Claybrook Zoo is a small family oriented zoo in the Northwest of England. Established in 1965 the zoo has a long history of providing educational support resources for members of the public to enhance their visiting experience. 

Matthew Jones is the current zoo manager and he has established contact with your software development company in an attempt to investigate the potential developing a software suite of products that will include: -

a)	A customer facing zoo website.
b)	Internally facing visitor information technologies.
c)	A zoo records administration/content management system that will allow a key business records for the zoo to be effectively managed.

You and your Software House has been approached by Matthew Jones (as the projects key stakeholder) to produce the specification, interface layouts and the architectural designs for the zoo’s proposed software suite. 

The following background information and requested user requirements have been supplied. It should be noted that at present the information provided is very limited and consequently you will need to carry out a series of client elicitation interviews, and other problem domain characteristics investigation to obtain a full description of the problem domain. 

Background/Client Supplied System Requirements

All animals within the zoo are currently located in several specific areas, these are:-

	The Aviary (Where all the birds are housed)
	The Hothouse (Where all reptiles and amphibians reside)
	The Aquarium (For all fish within the zoo)
	The Cages/Compounds. (Housing all mammals).

For all animal species within the zoo, the electronic catalogue will need to keep a record of the following essential data:-

•	Species Name.
•	Animal “given” Name.
•	Date of Birth of Animal.
•	Gender.
•	Average Life Span (e.g. months/years).
•	Species Category/Classification.
•	Dietary Requirements.
•	Natural Habitat Description.
•	Global Population Distribution.
•	Date animal joined the zoo.
•	Typical animal dimensions (e.g. height, weight).
Specialist information for specific types of animal will also be required and should include:-

Not all data will be displayed on the kiosk & websote but would rather remain in the RMS e.g date animal moved into the zoo.

Birds

•	Nest Construction Method.
•	Clutch size.
•	Wing span.
•	Ability to fly (Yes/No).
•	Plumage colour variants (possibly by gender). 

Fish

•	Average body temperature.
•	Water type (e.g. Salt/Fresh).
•	Colour variants (possibly by gender).

Reptiles and Amphibians

•	Reproduction type (e.g. egg layer/livebearer).
•	Average Clutch Size (Where reptile/amphibian is an egg layer).
•	Average number of offspring (Where reptile/amphibian is a livebearer).

Mammals

•	Gestational Period.
•	Mammal Category (e.g. Prototheria/Metatheria/Eutheria.)
•	Average body temperature.

As part of the minimum prototype specification the records management part of the system must have a suitable, high quality, graphical interface, that is intuitive and user friendly.  The software solution must allow the minimum functionality: -
 
	The addition of new animals to the zoo.
	The removal of animals from the zoo catalogue. 
	The ability to search the zoo catalogue, and display the appropriate search results, for a variety of user initiated searches (e.g. animals by category, by type, by habitat, etc).

Each animal within the system will require some form of unique identifier; it has been suggested that this identifier is based on the animal classification.  

The manager of Claybrook Zoo has indicated that he would like to see additional complex features included in the prototype system designs. He has provided a table listing some of the more complex functionality required: -

Table 1 - Additional Complex System Features/Functionality

Additional Features/Complex Functionality
Allowing complex search criteria combinations to be used to interrogate the database (e.g. searching for animals using multiple search criteria.)  using filters (advanced search)

Expanding the system to include details of the zoo’s animal sponsorship scheme. (The zoo currently allows members of the public or local companies to sponsor particular animals as a way of supporting the zoo financially)  sponsorahip scheme to be computerized 

Expanding the prototype to include animal cage/tank/compound locations to form a simple animal “stock” management system.

Include a graphical representation of animals held within the zoo’s database.

Produce a zoo website that will allow potential visitors to look at the critical zoo animals held within the zoo prior to actually visiting.  It is hoped that this zoo information will also encourage more visitors.

Investigate relevant technologies to exemplify how the zoo could incorporate possible touch- screen features as part of a visitor information kiosk system or a QR driven and Mobile Application running on smartphone that allows visitors to interact with the existing attractions at the zoo. QR code as an alternative to kiosks for interactive basis
Incorporate suitable security/access control features into the prototype software solution.

Generate automated and ad-hoc reports of key business events.


Again, it should be noted that the background information and system specifications provided in the assignment brief have purposely been left quite vague; as such you will be required to conduct several elicitation interviews with stakeholders in the potential system.

Four key stakeholders will be available for you to interview: -

a)	Matthew Jones: The current zoo manager and expert on existing organisational procedures and practice.

b)	Thomas Smith: An existing, regular visitor to the zoo, who has a good insight into the current visiting experience available for general members of the public.

c)	Jonathan Rodgers: A senior administrator within the zoo, who is responsible for running the animal sponsorship scheme.

d)	Phillip Brown: A local small business owner who is interested in the animal sponsorship scheme if he can perceive potential benefits by way of advertising/positive publicity available through the scheme.
